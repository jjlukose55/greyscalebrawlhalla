# greyscalebrawlhalla
A quick and easy python script for greyscaling Brawlhalla map art.

Just install the dependencies and run __main.py. The script will try to find the Brawlhalla directory and convert the images to greyscale. 
I also included the converted files and original files to compare and/or manually install.
